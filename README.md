<h2>Drum Kit</h2>

<p>This a very simple <strong>Drum Kit</strong> website that I created in my spare time to test my HTML, CSS, JavaScript and DOM skills.</p>

- To reproduce a sound, you can either left click with your mouse on the drum kit buttons or you can press the respective keyboard letter of the sound that you want to reproduce.
